MoodSync

- Mood Sync is a web application that utilizes OpenAI's 3.5 turbo natural language processor to provide users playlists based on their current mood.
- Users provide a short description of their mood, and the application generates variables such as valence, energy, and danceability.
- These variables are then used to recommend a playlist using the Spotify emotional categorization system.
- The project's main goals are to reinforce concepts in language models, serverless functions, and server-side rendering.
